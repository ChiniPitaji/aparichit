# JanRakshak - The Civic Justice Platform
**Tagline:** "Because justice delayed is justice denied."

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In India, citizens face numerous civic issues daily - from corruption in government offices to negligent municipal services and law enforcement failures. However, there's no unified platform where citizens can:

- Report issues anonymously without fear of retaliation
- Rally community support for unresolved problems  
- Track the progress of their complaints
- Hold authorities accountable through public pressure

Current complaint systems are fragmented, bureaucratic, and often ignore citizen voices.
